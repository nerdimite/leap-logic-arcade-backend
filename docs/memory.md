## Logs

Log #1:
Summary: Implemented DAO interfaces and team data access for the Pic Perfect challenge.

Core Changes:

- Created ChallengeState enum in arcade/types/**init**.py
- Implemented DAO interfaces: IDynamoDBDao, IImagesDao, ILeaderboardDao, IStateDao, and IPicPerfectService
- Updated DynamoDBDao and ImagesDao to explicitly implement their interfaces
- Created ITeamsDao interface to handle team operations
- Implemented TeamsDao class that extends DynamoDBDao and implements ITeamsDao
- Created comprehensive unit and integration tests for TeamsDao
- Added testing fixtures and setup in conftest.py files

Context Used:

- docs/design.md for interface specifications
- docs/style_guide.md for code style and testing guidelines
- arcade/core/dao/base_ddb.py as reference for DAO implementation

- arcade/core/interfaces/pic_perfect_service.py (created with IPicPerfectService interface)
- arcade/core/interfaces/teams_dao.py (created with ITeamsDao interface)
- arcade/core/dao/base_ddb.py (updated to implement IDynamoDBDao)

- tests/core/dao/test_teams_dao.py (created with unit tests for TeamsDao)
- tests/core/dao/test_teams_dao_integration.py (created with integration tests for TeamsDao)

Additional Notes:

- Fixed datetime mocking in tests to properly mock the method chain datetime.now().isoformat()
- Used the PLACEHOLDER pattern for empty sets in DynamoDB compatible format
- Added both unit and integration tests with appropriate mocking strategies
- Followed the project's testing guidelines with @pytest.mark decorators for test categorization

Log #2:
Summary: Implemented tests for ImagesDao and improved integration testing with moto.

Core Changes:

- Created comprehensive unit tests for ImagesDao in test_images_dao.py
- Created integration tests for ImagesDao using moto for DynamoDB simulation
- Refactored TeamsDao integration tests to use moto instead of manual mocking
- Removed unnecessary mock_boto3 fixture from conftest.py
- Updated all tests to use test constants from test_constants.py instead of hardcoded table names
- Fixed a bug in the vote_on_image_exceeded_limit test case to properly test the limit validation

Context Used:

- arcade/core/dao/images_dao.py for understanding implementation details
- arcade/core/interfaces/images_dao.py for interface specifications
- tests/core/dao/test_teams_dao.py as a reference for unit testing patterns
- tests/core/dao/test_teams_dao_integration.py as a reference for integration testing
- tests/test_constants.py for standardized test table names

Files Modified / Created:

- tests/core/dao/test_images_dao.py (created with unit tests for ImagesDao)
- tests/core/dao/test_images_dao_integration.py (created with integration tests for ImagesDao)
- tests/core/dao/test_teams_dao_integration.py (updated to use moto)
- tests/core/dao/conftest.py (simplified to remove mock_boto3)
- tests/conftest.py (updated to use test constants)

Additional Notes:

- Transitioned from simple mocking to using moto for realistic DynamoDB simulation
- Improved test stability by directly interacting with a mocked database
- Enhanced maintainability by using centralized test constants
- Tests now verify actual data persistence between operations rather than just checking if methods were called
- Fixed a bug where test_vote_on_image_exceeded_limit was trying to vote for a team already in the votes list

Log #3:
Summary: Implemented StateDao and standardized DAO integration testing.

Core Changes:

- Implemented StateDao class that extends DynamoDBDao and implements IStateDao
- Created methods for challenge lifecycle management: initialize, finalize, lock, unlock
- Added state validation and state transition functionality
- Implemented helper methods to check challenge status: is_active, is_locked, is_complete
- Created comprehensive unit and integration tests using moto for DynamoDB simulation
- Added challenge metadata and config support
- Standardized integration test fixtures across all DAO implementations
- Refactored all integration tests to use consistent patterns and approaches
- Fixed unit tests to properly mock StateDao methods
- Removed direct DynamoDB table creation from individual test files
- Consolidated table configuration in central setup_test_tables fixture

Context Used:

- arcade/core/interfaces/state_dao.py for the interface specification
- arcade/core/dao/base_ddb.py for DynamoDB DAO base class implementation

- tests/conftest.py (updated to include all test tables in setup_test_tables)
- tests/core/dao/test_images_dao_integration.py (updated to use patching instead of direct table reference)
- tests/core/dao/test_teams_dao_integration.py (updated to use patching instead of direct table reference)

Additional Notes:

- Implemented proper timestamp handling for challenge start and end times
- Added validation to prevent unlocking a challenge directly to LOCKED state
- Created full lifecycle integration test to verify state transitions
- Used proper logging for all operations
- Followed code style from existing DAOs
- Improved code reuse and maintainability by leveraging existing fixtures
