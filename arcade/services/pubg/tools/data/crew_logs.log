LOG_23401: Chief Engin&^%r Torres repo#ting. Completed recalibra@ion of the quantum stabiliz*rs. Note to maintenance: The fluctuations in deck 7 auxiliary systems persist despite replacement of the primary coupling.

LOG_23402: Sec#rity Prot@col Update: All emergency override seq*&nces now use the NATO ph$netic alphabet format.

LOG_2340~~3: Navigation Officer Chen's report: Long-range scanners have id&ntified three potential emergency docking locations. The Pr#xima facility remains optimal despite recent meteor activity in quadrant 4.

LOG_2!@#404: Captain's personal log: Daught%r's birthday is on May 17th. Used this date for the new override code as it's easy to remember.

LOG_234%5: Medical Officer's report: Crew health remains st@ble. Recommend incr*ased recreation time to combat signs of isolation stress.

LOG_234)6: Security Officer's note: Override codes follow format: NATO phonetic for month + NATO phonetic for day. Example: January 5th would be "Juliet-Fiver".

LOG_234@7: Navigation data update: Proxima Station has confirmed their position at coordinates 127.38.95.4. Alternate emergency coordinates for Outpost 37 (182.44.21.8) and Starbase 12 (091.22.76.3) stored in backup memory.

LOG_2340*: Science Officer's research log: Quantum entanglement experiments yielding fascinating results. Note that lab access now requires new security protocols.

LOG_2!409: Captain's bridge notes: Reminded crew about updated emergency protocols. The override code I set yesterday works perfectly.

LOG_23$10: Engineering diagnostic complete. Recommendation to increase power allocation to forward shields when approaching coordinates 127.38.95.4 due to recent meteor activity.
