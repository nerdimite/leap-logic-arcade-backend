## 3. Emergency Protocols

### 3.1 Power Distribution Override

To reallocate power during emergency situations, use the Power Distribution Controller with proper authorization code. Override codes are required for all systems.

### 3.2 Navigation Emergency Procedures

In case of navigation system failure, the Emergency Course Correction protocol can be executed from the file location: `/protocols/nav/course_correct.dat`

### 3.3 Override Code Format

All emergency override sequences use the NATO phonetic alphabet format. For dates, the format is: NATO phonetic for month + NATO phonetic for day.

Example: January 5th would be "Juliet-Fiver"

### 3.4 Emergency Coordinates

### 4.1 Priority Systems

During power shortages, maintain these systems at or above minimum requirements:

1. Life Support
2. Navigation
3. Main Engines
4. Shield Generators
5. Quantum Stabilizers

### 4.2 Secondary Systems

These systems can be reduced to minimum requirements:

1. Communications
2. Sensor Array
3. Emergency Thrusters
4. Artificial Gravity
5. Cargo Bay Systems

### 4.3 Non-Essential Systems

These systems can be temporarily powered down:
